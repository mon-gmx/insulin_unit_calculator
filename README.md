# insulin_unit_calculator

This is a simple calculator based on carb intake and sugar levels. I have no expertise on the topic, just doing this project to help people like me trying to make things easy to keep track of that tiny extra that keeping track on the condition and these basic metrics. The objective of this project is not to be used by thirdparties or serve as guideline to anyone dealing with this condition, it is just a way to simplify input of data and sharing such data with health professionals, that's really it.

This UI will offer a simple calculator and a way to collect data using google sheets as data layer, so actually all credit goes to google APIs where collective reading and the ability to use a spreadsheet via browser or my own service is possible.

Interested in using it? Open an issue and explain your need, I will be glad to help.
